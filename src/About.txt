This repo contains DSA in java.

Plan: After learning each concept go to leetcode and practice the same concept wise problems.

Data Structure:
       1. Organizes and stores the data.
       2. Each has strength and weakness

The fact is, there aren't just two sides to any issue, there's almost always a range of responses, and "it depends" is

        7. Stir the contents of the cup with spoon

    These are the steps need to make a tea.

    Note:
        There can be many algorithms that accomplish the same task
        There can be many implementations of same algorithm
